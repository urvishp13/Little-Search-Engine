This method indexes all keywords found in all the input documents. When this
method is done, the keywordsIndex hash table will be filled with all keywords,
each of which is associated with an array list of Occurrence objects, arranged
in decreasing frequencies of occurrence.

Inserts the last occurrence in the parameter list in the correct position in the
same list, based on ordering occurrences on descending frequencies. The elements
0..n-2 in the list are already in the correct order. Insertion of the last element
(the one at index n-1) is done by first finding the correct spot using binary search, 
then inserting at that spot.
