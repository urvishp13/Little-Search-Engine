This is a hash table of all keywords. The key is the actual keyword, and the associated value is
an array list of all occurrences of the keyword in documents. The array list is maintained in descending
order of occurrence frequencies.

Merges the keywords for a single document into the master keywordsIndex
hash table. For each keyword, its Occurrence in the current document
must be inserted in the correct place (according to descending order of
frequency) in the same keyword's Occurrence list in the master hash table. 
This is done by calling the insertLastOccurrence method.

This class builds an index of keywords. Each keyword maps to a set of documents in
which it occurs, with frequency of occurrence in each document. Once the index is built,
the documents can searched on for keywords.
